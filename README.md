# Optimization Ambulance Service in New Orlearns

The City of New Orleans tasks me and my team design an R code that helps them to schedule their ambulance services.  We create a script that can predict when New Orleans will have not ambulance not available and the right amount of ambulances to cover the deficiency. 

The central prediction is model of the script is Erlang B.  The Erlang loss formula, is a formula for the blocking probability that original was created to predict the likelihood of call losses in telephone circuits. Erlag B is used for predicting the probability of nonavailable ambulance instead of the probability of telephone circuit been overloaded.
